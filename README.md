# TRH9000 and TRH9000S
Yamaha V9990 based open-source video cards for the MSX

## Introduction

If you ever spent just a few minutes on YouTube searching for MSX content, I bet you certainly found some footage covering the V9990. Well, not specifically the V9990 chip, but video cards based on it.

The first video card based on the unreleased, kind of obscure Yamaha V9990 VDP chip was the Graphics9000 (or GFX9000). The GFX9000 is (was) an MSX standard graphics expansion device for home computers developed by Sunrise in 1994.

It was designed as an expansion cartridge for the MSX standard that can be installed in a slot on a computer that also connects to the computer’s video output and monitor. The device works as an additional independent video controller.

The device is based on the Yamaha V9990 video controller (VDP). The chip was based on the never-produced V9978 chip, designed specifically for use in computers of the alleged but not implemented (by the time of this writing) MSX3 standard. Compared to the V9978, the V9990 is not backward compatible with the V99x8 chips, and thus cannot be used as the main video controller of standard MSX-compatible computers.

## The TRH9000 and the TRH9000S

TRH9000 is the name of a brand new open-source implementation of the GFX9000. It is a community effort to create everything required to build MSX cartridges capable to run V9990 software.

TRH9000S has the same features of the simpler TRH9000 plus the capability to superimpose the image from the MSX computer where it is connected to the image generated by the V9990 VDP (using a cable connected to an input RGB connector on the cartridge).

The goal is to make the card more accessible and improve the amount of software available for it.

## Technical Information

MSX cartridges typically contain a number of electronic components that allow them to function as expansion devices for an MSX computer. These components typically include the following:

* ROM chips: Most MSX cartridges contain ROM (read-only memory) chips that store the software or firmware that runs on the cartridge. These chips are typically non-volatile, meaning that they retain their contents even when the cartridge is not powered.

* RAM chips: Some MSX cartridges may also contain RAM (random access memory) chips that can be used to store data or temporary information. These chips are typically volatile, meaning that they lose their contents when the cartridge is powered off.

* Connectors: MSX cartridges contain connectors that allow them to be plugged into the cartridge slot of an MSX computer. These connectors may be located on the top, bottom, or sides of the cartridge, depending on the design of the cartridge.

* Control logic: MSX cartridges may contain control logic circuits that are used to manage the operation of the cartridge and communicate with the MSX computer. These circuits may include microcontrollers, programmable logic devices, or other types of control logic.

* Other components: Depending on the specific functions of the cartridge, it may also contain other components such as voltage regulators, buffers, latches, or drivers.

Overall, the electronic components of an MSX cartridge work together to allow the cartridge to function as an expansion device for the MSX computer, adding new hardware or software capabilities to the system.

For the TRH9000, the control logic is implemented by two ICs. According to the not exhaustive list of IO ports documented [here](https://www.msx.org/wiki/I/O_Ports_List). The IO ports used the by an GFX9000 compatible cartridge must be 60h~6Fh*. The 74HCT138 IC on the board performs the selection of those IO ports and with the aid of the 74HC32 performs the activation of the appropriate signals on the V9990 chip.
