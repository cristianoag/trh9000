# TRH9000 and TRH9000S
Yamaha V9990 based open-source video cards for the MSX

## Introduction

If you ever spent just a few minutes on YouTube searching for MSX content, I bet you certainly found some footage covering the V9990. Well, not specifically the V9990 chip, but video cards based on it.

The first video card based on the unreleased, kind of obscure Yamaha V9990 VDP chip was the Graphics9000 (or GFX9000). The GFX9000 is (was) an MSX standard graphics expansion device for home computers developed by Sunrise in 1994.

It was designed as an expansion cartridge for the MSX standard that can be installed in a slot on a computer that also connects to the computer’s video output and monitor. The device works as an additional independent video controller.

The device is based on the Yamaha V9990 video controller (VDP). The chip was based on the never-produced V9978 chip, designed specifically for use in computers of the alleged but not implemented (by the time of this writing) MSX3 standard. Compared to the V9978, the V9990 is not backward compatible with the V99x8 chips, and thus cannot be used as the main video controller of standard MSX-compatible computers.

## The TRH9000 and the TRH9000S

TRH9000 is a recently developed open-source implementation of the GFX9000, representing a community-driven effort to document everything necessary to build MSX cartridges that can run V9990 software.

TRH9000S has the same features of the simpler TRH9000 plus the capability to superimpose the image from the MSX computer where it is connected to the image generated by the V9990 VDP (using a cable connected to an input RGB connector on the cartridge).

The goal is to make the card more accessible and improve the amount of software available for it.

## Technical Information

The TRH9000 is a graphics expansion cartridge designed for MSX computers that was developed by a community of MSX enthusiasts as an open-source implementation of the GFX9000. 

### Selection Logic
For the TRH9000, the control logic is implemented by two ICs. According to the not exhaustive list of IO ports documented [here](https://www.msx.org/wiki/I/O_Ports_List). The IO ports used the by an GFX9000 compatible cartridge must be 60h~6Fh*. The 74HCT138 IC on the board performs the selection of those IO ports and with the aid of the 74HC32 performs the activation of the appropriate signals on the V9990 chip.

### RAM chips

The KM428C256 RAM chip is the primary memory module used in the TRH9000 for MSX. It is a CMOS 256K x 8 bit dual-port dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip that serves as the primary memory module in the TRH9000 for MSX. We use two memory chips on the cartridge, wired to the Yamaha V9990 VDP.

### Connectors

The TRH9000 features two types of video output connectors: a DB15 RGB/VGA connector and a pin header that carries the SVIDEO signal. The DB15 connector is a standard video connector that supports VGA, and RGB, making it a versatile choice for connecting to various types of displays. The SVIDEO signal, on the other hand, is a video signal that carries the chrominance and luminance components of the video separately, resulting in a higher quality image than composite video. 

The SVIDEO signal is carried via the pin header, which is also included in the TRH9000 cartridge. This provides users with the flexibility to choose the type of video output connector that best suits their display device. 

Additionally, the TRH9000S version of the cartridge features two connectors, including a DIN8 270 connector that allows for input from the MSX computer and the DB15 RGB/VGA connector for video output.
