# TRH9000
The Yamaha V9990 based open-source video card for the MSX

## Kicad Project Files

* MSX_Breadboard_Large_V9990/ - Project for the prototype cartridge to validate the main TRH9000 circuit. The board project is based on the work done by Alexey Wierzbowsky and was adapted to have pads for memory chips, V9990, and two different video chips. We are testing the Sony RGB encoder (CXA2075M) and the TI Auto-Detecting SD/HD/PC Video Sync Separator (LMH1980) to generate the video signal.
* TRH9000/ - Main TRH9000 circuit and PCB board project.
* TRH9000S/ - Main TRH9000S circuit and PCB board project. This version offers two connectors. One DIN8 270 to get input from the MSX computer and another DB15 as the RGB/VGA output.
